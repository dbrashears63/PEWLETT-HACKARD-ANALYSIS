# PEWLETT-HACKARD-ANALYSIS

## Overview 
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to prepare Pewlett-Hackard, with thousands of employees, for the “silver-tsunami”. Many employees are nearing retirement age in the next few years and HR has been tasked with preparing an analysis of how many employees are eligible for retirement in the next few years, how many open positions, will need to be filled and which employees are eligible for the mentorship program.  To ensure a smooth transition this analysis will focus on the following:
1.	Identify which employees are nearing retirement by title
2.	Ascertain how many employees by title are nearing retirement age
3.	Establish which employees are eligible for the mentorship program
